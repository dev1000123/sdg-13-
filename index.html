    <h3>Climate Action</h3>
    <p>According to UNDP, climate action “means stepped-up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen
   resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-induced impacts, including: climate-related hazards in all countries;
   integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning; and improving education, 
  awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity with respect to climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.”</p>

  <section style="height: 150px;"><h1>What are SDG's</h1><br><b style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known
     as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal 
     call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all 
     people enjoy peace and prosperity.

    The 17 SDGs are integrated—they recognize that action in one area will affect 
    outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and 
    environmental sustainability.</b></section>

    <h1><b>SDG 13</b></h1>
    <p><b>
      
Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts, floods and tropical cyclones, aggravating
water management problems, reducing agricultural production and food security, increasing health risks, damaging critical infrastructure and interrupting 
the provision of basic services such water and sanitation, education, energy and transport.
